![A demo of Elm Reactor showing a list of Pokemon](./demo.gif)

## Run the example

If you already have [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html), you can run the app with this command:

```
elm reactor
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm`

### Using the PokeAPI

This example app uses the free PokeAPI, which enforces a rate-limit of 100 calls per hour.
